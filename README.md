## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js
- **Design Framework**: Tailwind CSS

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js as the frontend framework for this project for several reasons:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js provides built-in support for SSR, which improves SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server and sending them to the client. This is crucial for a web app that may require good search engine visibility.

2. **Routing**: Next.js has a straightforward and flexible routing system that allows for easy navigation between pages, making it suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) like this tip calculator.

3. **Developer Experience**: It offers a great developer experience with features like fast refresh, automatic code splitting, and easy deployment options.

4. **Vercel Integration**: Next.js is developed by Vercel, and it integrates seamlessly with the Vercel platform, simplifying deployment and hosting. This is why I chose to deploy the app on Vercel.

## How to Run the App

To run the Tip Calculator app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WahabAfridi789/tip-calculator.git
